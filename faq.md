### What is canine.tools?
canine.tools is a collection of open source and private frontends and services. canine.tools is furry fandom themed.

### Server info?
This server is located in the United States. The main IP of the server is `45.90.12.117`.
* Debian 12
* Intel Xeon Gold 6152 (2.095GHz)
* 10GB Ram
* 5Gbit connection

I'm looking into a dedicated machine in the future.

### Why am I getting blocked?
I block certain (mostly default) user agents from accessing all services. If you want to not be blocked, please set a proper user agent when using software like curl.

### How can I trust you?
You can't. I follow best practices and try my best to make everything private. Be cautious when using services with personal information.

If you need to host sensitive text or files, encrypt them.

### Who runs this?
The sole maintainer of caine.tools is [hyperdefined](https://hyper.lol). You can email me here: `hyper@canine.tools`.
