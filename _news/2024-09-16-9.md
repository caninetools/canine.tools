I've hardened the webserver for all services due to our mozhi's instance API getting spammed. It looks like an attempt to DDoS by spamming the API with random text it finds online (probably AI?). It went on for about 2 hours before I caught on and started to block it. If you end up getting blocked but you're a real user, please contact me!

I touched up the homepage a bit to better sort the frontends and services, I think it looks a lot better.

Lastly, I added 2 new services: [vault.canine.tools](https://vault.canine.tools/) and [vikunja.canine.tools](https://vikunja.canine.tools/). ~~Vault is invite only for the time being, but might change in the future.~~ It's now since been public registration.
