### What is canine.tools?
canine.tools is a collection of open source and private frontends and services. canine.tools is furry fandom themed. We are LGBTQ+ friendly and accept all! It originally start in June of 2023 as fluffy.tools. I decided to start the project up again around July of 2024.

### Server Specs & Information
This server is located in the United States, specifically east coast. The main IPs of the server are `15.204.224.249` and `2604:2dc0:101:200::5427`. This server is powered by [OVH](https://us.ovhcloud.com/).

Backups are done every hour and stored encrypted offsite. You can run a [speedtest](https://speedtest.canine.tools) from you to the server to see your connection to the server. It's not 100% accurate, but it exists.

### Why am I getting blocked?
This server has protections for all services to prevent bots & abuse.

### Can I trust you?
You can't trust me 100%. I follow best practices and try my best to make everything private. Be cautious when using services with personal information. I will never intentionally leak anyone's data, unless you're being malicious.

If you need to host sensitive text or files, encrypt them before publishing them.
