## Donate Directly

If you want to donate to the project directly, you can do so at [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/canine.tools). 50% of each donations will go towards an animal charity of my choosing. The other 50% will go towards server costs. Once there are enough donations, I will setup a transparency page detailing what charities I donated to.

Below shows the costs of running canine.tools.
