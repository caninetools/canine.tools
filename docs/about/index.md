## What is canine.tools?
The canine.tools project is a collection of open source and private frontends and services. canine.tools is furry fandom themed. We are LGBTQ+ friendly and accept all! It originally start in June of 2023 as fluffy.tools. We decided to start the project up again around July of 2024.

This project focuses on user privacy and providing services for everyone to use. You can read more about our [privacy](https://canine.tools/privacy) and our [terms](https://canine.tools/terms).

## Server Specs & Information
This server is located in the United States, specifically east coast. The main IPs of the server are `15.204.224.249` and `2604:2dc0:101:200::5427`. This server is powered by [OVH](https://us.ovhcloud.com/).

Backups are done every hour and stored encrypted offsite. You can run a [speedtest](https://speedtest.canine.tools) from you to the server to see your connection to the server. It's not 100% accurate, but it exists.

We also use a rotating proxy service for some of the services we host. This is used to bypass IP restrictions or ratelimits.

## Can I trust you?
You can never trust a random stranger on the internet. However, we run this service as a passion project. We will never use anyone's personal data for any reason. We will never intentionally leak anyone's data or sell it to other parties.

If you need to host sensitive text or files, encrypt them before publishing them to any service provided by canine.tools.
