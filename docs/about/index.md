## What is canine.tools?
The canine.tools project is a collection of open source and private frontends and services. It originally started in June of 2023 as `fluffy.tools`. It started as a small site to host things for my own use. I find these things useful, and want to share them for anyone to use. It ended up closing sometime later. It relaunched around a year later in 2024 as the canine.tools we love.

I strive for user privacy. You can read more about our [privacy](https://canine.tools/privacy) and our [terms](https://canine.tools/terms).

## Server Specs & Information
This server is located in the United States, specifically east coast. The main IPs of the server are `15.204.224.249` and `2604:2dc0:101:200::5427`. This server is powered by [OVH](https://us.ovhcloud.com/).

Backups are done every hour and stored encrypted offsite. You can run a [speedtest](https://speedtest.canine.tools) from you to the server to see your connection to the server. It's not 100% accurate, but it exists.

We also use a rotating proxy or VPN service for some services we host. This is used to bypass IP restrictions or ratelimits.

## Can I trust you?
You can never trust a random stranger on the internet. However, I run this service as a passion project. I will never use anyone's personal data for any reason. I will never sell or share your data from canine.tools to any other party.

If you need to host sensitive text or files, encrypt them before publishing them to any service provided by canine.tools.
