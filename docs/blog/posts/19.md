## Service Blocks
In the past weeks, our server has been blocked by a few websites that our frontends proxy. Since requests are coming from our IP only, it's easy to block it as we have no other way around.

* [AnonymousOverflow](https://overflow.canine.tools/) has been getting blocked because of Cloudflare (getting captcha page).
* [BreezeWiki](https://breeze.canine.tools/) has getting blocked *hard.* Every single request was being blocked by Fandom. I wasn't sure how to tackle it, and the codebase *kind of sucks.*
* [cobalt](https://cobalt.canine.tools/) had issues with YouTube blocks.
* [dumb](https://dumb.canine.tools/) had issues from the start. The developers even stated to use some type of proxy since it's behind Cloudflare. It was *fine* but off and on working.
* [SearXNG](https://search.canine.tools/) was getting blocked by a few engines for too many requests.
* [Quetre](https://quetre.canine.tools/) was getting blocked *hard*.

I've been looking into ways to get around these blocks. Since we had a rotating proxy, I tried to set it up with these services. However, they either didn't like using the proxy or it was blocked regardless.

## Solution to Service Blocks
Randomly in a Discord server, I saw someone mention [Gluetun](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun). Gluetun is a simple VPN client. It lets you setup a container to route all network through a VPN service. I figured this could be useful, as VPN IPs *could* be more legit to these services instead of a random OVH IP. Since I use and pay for [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com), I already get [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) included, which Gluetun has support for.

I configured the services above to route all traffic through Gluetun. After monitoring them, the blocks are basically gone!

* [AnonymousOverflow](https://overflow.canine.tools/) is now completely functional due to a custom fork of [AnonymousOverflow](https://git.ngn.tf/ngn/anonymous_overflow) that uses a Cloudflare captcha solver.
* [BreezeWiki](https://breeze.canine.tools/) is now completely functional.
* [cobalt](https://cobalt.canine.tools/) works *waaaaayyyy* better, but not 100%. YouTube works *sometimes* but other services (like Twitch) fully work.
* [dumb](https://dumb.canine.tools/) is now completely functional (and faster!).
* [SearXNG](https://search.canine.tools/) seems to be better. Does report "timeouts" more which is probably from Gluetun swapping VPN servers mid request.
* [Quetre](https://quetre.canine.tools/) is now completely functional (with some user agent messing around).

## Dependency Explosion
[Quetre](https://quetre.canine.tools/) & [Wikiless](https://wikiless.canine.tools/) both had their dependencies updated, which ended up completely breaking both codebases. We update images automatically, so it pulled the changes and ended up breaking. However, I was able to fix this issues myself and they are now up and running.

## Donations
Lastly, some small change to the donation system. We now accept donations via Patreon! Furthermore, due to us not need a rotating proxy anymore, that cost has been eliminated!
