## Anubis Changes
If you don't remember, we use [Anubis](https://anubis.techaro.lol/) in order to prevent mass scraping of bots (we only care about real users). You can read more about the deployment in the [previous post](https://canine.tools/blog/2025/04/27/anubis-report-1/).

One of the most obvious change is the art being used. Since then, canine.tools has become a supporter of the main developer of Anubis. One of the features is a custom version of Anubis that lets us use our own branding.

We don't have a mascot, so I decided to use [my own fursona](https://hyper.lol/fursona). He will be used for the mascot going forward for Anubis. I hope you don't mind him :)

I've also added some policies in order to be more compatible with other websites (specifically embeds).

## Bye Bye NGINX
Unfortunately, it's time to get rid of NGINX. I have personally used it for *years*. It has gotten to become very annoying to maintain over these past weeks, so we decided to look around for something better. With our configuration having many, many server blocks, making changes became increasingly frustrating. We wanted to have per host metrics, which the basic NGINX metrics do not offer. NGINX Plus offers it, but [their pricing is ridiculous...](https://redlib.canine.tools/r/devops/comments/r2hn6k/wtf_is_up_with_nginx_plus/)

No thanks, *thousands of dollars* for server software? Also, why do they even have this paid tier of NGINX?

Anyways, the first server software that came to mind was [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/). I've seen it used many times in our containers and around more recent web development. So we decided to pull the plug on NGINX and make the swap completely.

The transition went smoothly, we had some downtime for maybe an hour at most. I made sure to take my time migrating the server blocks over *correctly*.

I also *finally* corrected duplicate headers from appearing. This was bothering me for a long time. I had a `commons.conf` file that was included in every server block. This file included settings for TLS & common headers. However, on the backend applications, they like to set their own headers. This would sometimes clash and duplicate headers would appear. I didn't know how to fix this without specifying headers *for every single server block*. I really didn't want to take the time and energy. However, with this migration, I decided to take the time and energy to fix it.

I really liked setting up Caddy. Their configuration is extremely easier to follow, which I am happy with. It's definitely something I am using long term moving forward.

## Grafana & Monitoring
Finally, after many attempts, I have setup [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)! For the longest time, I used [Netdata](https://www.netdata.cloud/). However, I really didn't like it personally. The alerts system never worked, which was crucial to me. I also don't like to use software that has subscription tiers. Their pricing is a bit high for our use, which is why we moved to self hosting.

I have finally setup some fancy dashboards and alerts for when shit hits the fan.

## New Uptime Monitoring
Speaking of not using software with subscriptions, I decided to move away from [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/). This is what service our status page was using. Since we have a lot of monitors, pricing on these types of services can be high. Furthermore, we believed self hosting would be better, as that can eliminate network issues. Some services had network issues from where UptimeRobot was pinging them.

We are now using [Uptime Kuma](https://uptimekuma.org/).

## Conclusion
These were much needed changes for the canine.tools project. I am happier with my recent work, and hopefully can improve the recent changes to be even better.
