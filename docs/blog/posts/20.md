For transparency, here is how we lost around a day's worth of data.

## What happened?
Around 12:20 PM (GMT-4) July 21 2025, all databases on our MySQL server were wiped away. Normally, this could be fixed and ~20 minutes of data would be lost, as the last backup would of ran at 12:00 PM. However, the backup system was disabled the day prior at 1:00 PM (GMT-4) from other issues.

## How did this happen?
For context, we use a backup system consisting of Bash scripts. We have a few and they run every hour. This scripts do the following:

* Backup a few "static" directories, mostly config files in `/etc/`.
* Dump all databases from MySQL.
* Backup the entire `/docker/stacks` folder, which hold the data to most containers.
* Afterwards, encrypt the archives and upload to a Cloudflare R2 bucket.

All of these scripts worked fine for a long time. Turns out, they were having some issues. Because of this, I decided to stop the scripts from running. I had some scripts stop some containers, and as containers would write data and cause the compression to fail. This script would break and leave the container offline. This caused some outages, as they would be random and I would have to manually start the service again.

Afterwards, I decided to work on a new backup system from the ground up. While working on this new system, I took down the MySQL container via `docker compose down`. I did this in order to backup the container itself, not the data inside (like configs). However, restarting the container showed the results. All data inside the container was gone.

Upon further inspection, turns out **I never set a data volume for the container.** It was a ticking time bomb. Such an embarrassing mistake. I had to reload the backup from the previous day, which means data from after the backup until now is gone.

## Improvements & Apology
I'm sorry if you were affected by some data loss. The services affected were: `Vaultwarden`, `Vikunja`, `Wakapi`, and `PrivateBin`. I even lost all of my Grafana data, as that was never even backed up in the first place... I am sorry about the data loss, it's gone forever.

For improvements, I moved MySQL off of Docker and onto the host of the server. Instead of just dumping databases, I am also backing up the entire `/var/lib/mysql` folder too.

Furthermore, I have completed the new backup system (you can see the source code [here](https://github.com/caninetools/backup)). I have proper monitoring of it so I can track it working.
