Hello friends and fluffs, I have some important updates for end of July 2025. This has been an eventful month of things for canine.tools.

## Anubis Fixed!
Over a week ago (this is an estimate), Anubis was having some issues with validating users. If you don't know, Anubis is our form of bot protection. [We've deployed it earlier this year around end of March](../posts/15.md). It's been a great success against blocking a lot of automated attacks we've seen in the past.

The issue was:

* You visiting a site with Anubis hosted by us.
* Anubis would check your connection and fail. You would get "invalid response."
* Clicking "Go home" or visiting the site again would let you through.

However, with this issue this past week, I can finally say it has been fixed. A big thank you to the main developer, [Xe Iaso](https://xeiaso.net/), for investigating this issue. Turns out, I was the only person having this problem.

### The Cause
I asked Xe to give me a quick run down of the issue.

* Anubis relies on a lot of its detection and assertion logic being as idempotent as possible per client, meaning that if a client matches one rule they match that rule as much as possible.
* There was a bug (that she is still tracing down) that caused that logic to be not idempontent at the worst time: when challenges were issued and validated. This caused Anubis to issue a proof of work challenge and validate it against the meta refresh challenge.
* This was fixed by removing the places where things could be not idempontent and storing additional state on the server side when issuing a challenge, including:
    * The challenge method name
    * The challenge metadata
* She is doing a review of a lot of the other parts of the challenge flow to ensure that as much data as possible is stored on the server side so that this kind of idempotency can't happen again and am also working on a regression test to verify this exact case.

Sorry to everyone who was facing this issue. [Please support the Anubis project](https://anubis.techaro.lol/docs/funding), it has helped our infrastructure a lot!!!

## Backup System
In the last post, we had some data loss due to a mistake on my end with out MySQL server and broken backup system. Since then, the new backup system has been working amazingly. I can assure something like the last incident won't happen again.

The backup system has yet to encounter any issues. Furthermore, I doubled checked and made sure it was backing up everything it needed to. I also tested the backups themselves to verify we can restore from them. I am very confident with this sytem rather than some janky Bash scripts.
