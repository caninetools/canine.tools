Around 2 months ago, we started to use Anubis for bot protection. Let's look at the stats since then.

## Services
To start, let's showcase what sites under canine.tools are using Anubis.

* Our site here!
* [breeze.canine.tools](https://breeze.canine.tools)
* [dumb.canine.tools](https://dumb.canine.tools)
* [libremdb.canine.tools](https://libremdb.canine.tools)
* [mozhi.canine.tools](https://mozhi.canine.tools)
* [overflow.canine.tools](https://overflow.canine.tools)
* [priviblur.canine.tools](https://priviblur.canine.tools)
* [quetre.canine.tools](https://quetre.canine.tools)
* [read.canine.tools](https://read.canine.tools)
* [redlib.canine.tools](https://redlib.canine.tools)
* [rimgo.canine.tools](https://rimgo.canine.tools) (not anymore, but it's data is included here)
* [tent.canine.tools](https://tent.canine.tools)
* [wikiless.canine.tools](https://wikiless.canine.tools)

Most of these are private frontends for other websites. **These sites are targeted for scraping.** More specifically, our [SearXNG](https://docs.searxng.org/) instance, which is a search engine. Many scrapers love to try and search and scrap the results.

## Data

Across all the services above, Anubis was hit **over 76k** times as of writing this post (04/27/25 8:24pm to 06/18/2025 8:30pm EST). Almost funny how the times are the same?

* **Total Challenges: 63,042** - how many times a client was challenged.
* **Denied: 6,835** - how many times Anubis blocked a client based on our policy.

[In the last post](16.md), Anubis was hit **49,446** times across 2 weeks. You would expect our 75k total to be higher after *2 months*, but it's not! Anubis has introduced since then customization of HTTP status codes for the challenge page. This let's us set the challenge page to be HTTP 403. This should deter most scrapers, as they want to check if it's a valid response. This doesn't stop them completely, but it's a guess! A normal user doesn't care about HTTP codes unless it's a proper error page.

Furthermore, we also used [fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban) to ban IPs that are on our deny list or fail a challenge.

### Denied Clients
We denied 6,835 clients, but what clients were they?

**Fake Browsers might not be 100% correct.*

Like last post, the top 1 client Anubis blocked was Headless Chrome.
