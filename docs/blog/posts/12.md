New services & possible fixes to our networking issues.
<!-- more -->

It's been a bit, but I have some changes that were happening under the hood.

Few weeks ago, our provider was having some major issues. I've since contacted them and network seems to be much better. There were random drops or connection fails. This was from their upstream. Since then, everything has been very stable. This also resulted in things on the machine not updating, but since has been resolved.

I moved from Mastodon to Bluesky for any "quick" status changes. I use Bluesky myself, and I figured moving there for more updates from me would be better. You can follow the account here: [@canine.tools](https://bsky.app/profile/canine.tools).

I've also added 3 services that were not announced, but posted on the main site:

* [binternet.canine.tools](https://binternet.canine.tools/)
* [priviblur.canine.tools](https://priviblur.canine.tools/)
* [libremdb.canine.tools](https://libremdb.canine.tools/)

~~Lastly, we have a new logo once again. It didn't feel right using a logo that didn't fit, but now we have a new one! This logo was created by [lostdusty](https://lostdusty.dev.br/). Please thank her for her work.~~
