Changes for January 30, 2025.
<!-- more -->

Hello woofers (and humans...)! I've been busy recently, but we've been running good for a few more months now. Happy new year!

~~I will be upgrading the server in the coming days/weeks, as we are just about out of disk space.~~ - Turns out storage was being consumed by random garbage, this has cleared up well over ~30GB, oopsie. The goal in the far future is to get a dedicated machine, but that is for another time.

I've finally fixed our backup system to not randomly fail.
