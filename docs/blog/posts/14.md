We've moved server hosts to OVH!
<!-- more -->

Hello fluffs (and humans...)! I bring some major changes to canine.tools backend. We've moved hosts!

We've been using RoyaleHosting for our server host, but there have been lots of issues recently. Mostly network issues. It seems like connections to the server would drop at random times for a random duration, and there was nothing I could do. I'm assuming it was an upstream issue, but I rather have a more stable server host for our services.

We've since moved to OVH, and I am looking forward to using them again (it's been years). So far everything has been migrated over without issues. Hopefully this means uptime will improve!
