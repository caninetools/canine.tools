These are terms (aka rules) you must follow when using canine.tools services. Due note, I am one single person running this. If there is something I missed, please contact me.

These are *general* rules to follow. However, I can make my own decisions for content on this site. Please don't be an asshole.

### Community Rules
* We are a welcoming service, please do not harass or bully anyone.
* No discrimination against race, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, or gender.

### Content Rules
* Do not post or store illegal content on canine.tools. If you want a private service for that, don't use this site.
* Do not break United States laws. If contacted, I will comply with any of law enforcement's requests.
* NSFW content is fine, but please label it correctly and share it with users of age.
* No extreme gore or hate speech allowed.

### Network Rules
* Do not disrupt canine.tools services with malicious intent.
* No mass scraping or bots.
