These are terms/rules you must follow when accessing the canine.tools project. Due note, I am one single person running this. If there is something I missed, please contact me.

These are *general* rules to follow. However, I can make my own decisions for content on this site. Please don't be an asshole.

If you are seen breaking these rules, you will be blocked from the canine.tools project.
