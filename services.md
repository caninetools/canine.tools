The canine.tools project provides lot of different frontends and services. If you want one requested, contact me!

#### Frontends
Frontends are alternative ways to view a website. These frontends below proxy all traffic through our server. These frontends get the information you need without ads, tracking you, and are faster.

You can use the browser extension [LibRedirect](https://libredirect.github.io/) to automatically redirect to these frontends.
