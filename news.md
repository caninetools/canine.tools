### November 5, 2024
Earlier today, there was an insane amount of requests to the SearXNG instance. Turns out, it was another DDoS attempt! They used over 13k IP addresses, and did not stop. I've harden the instance searching a bit, sorry if you get blocked! Wait a few minutes.

I've posted the IP ranges [here](https://paste.canine.tools/?5c780a84ba6faa4d#Fu7iav8XAbFnmULGuW2kDCYoUS84RcqaiJxLjGocxi6L), I will most likely report them to the hosting companies since this was super annoying. If your IPs is one of these, sorry!

Small but noticeable change, there is a new logo! The icon/favicon for canine.tools comes from <a href="https://mutant.tech/">Mutant Standard emoji</a>, which are licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 International</a>. Please give them some love and support.

canine.tools has been running for 2 months now smoothly, looking for a great future!

### September 16, 2024
I've hardened the webserver for all services due to our mozhi's instance API getting spammed. It looks like an attempt to DDoS by spamming the API with random text it finds online. It went on for about 2 hours before I caught on and started to block it. If you end up getting blocked but you're a real user, please contact me!

I touched up the homepage a bit to better sort the frontends and services, I think it looks a lot better.

Lastly, I added 2 new services: [vault.canine.tools](https://vault.canine.tools/) and [vikunja.canine.tools](https://vikunja.canine.tools/). Vault is invite only for the time being, but might change in the future.

canine.tools is no longer proxied via Cloudflare. I figured having it proxied would push some users away, so I turned it off.

I also added a new service, [breeze.canine.tools](https://breeze.canine.tools).
