### August 27, 2024
New website, once again. I decided to make a new homepage to better talk about this site.
I also added a new service: [it-tools.canine.tools](https://it-tools.canine.tools/).

### August 26, 2024
A lot of new services were added:
* [redlib.canine.tools](https://redlib.canine.tools/)
* [search.canine.tools](https://search.canine.tools/)
* [read.canine.tools](https://read.canine.tools/)

### August 23, 2024
New service was added: [safe.canine.tools](https://safe.canine.tools/). This is invite only for the time being.

I also created a [stats page]({{ site.url }}/stats), you can see some server stats for fun.

### August 22, 2024
New services were added: [pdf.canine.tools](https://pdf.canine.tools) & [mozhi.canine.tools](https://mozhi.canine.tools).

I also updated the homepage to include more information about the services, and a [privacy policy page]({{ site.url }}/privacy).

### June 20, 2024
A status page was created: [status.canine.tools](https://status.canine.tools).

Any news before this was not important, and I honestly don't remember what happened earlier.
